Management Science (2023)](https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/full/10.1287/mnsc.2023.4695?casa_token=diOIUo7s9XcAAAAA%3Alo9f4mKnjbsQtbvR28zS6n9hipGDYRP_xTLSgvbe0s7tuFoJzEJU72wEjULvUTJOeu_weS_ymq5N)      |    This paper proposes a GAN based deep learning   model for moeling stock return. The authors craftully connect no arbitrage condition for asset pricing with deep learning. In sort, they use generative adversarial network to find SDF stochastic discount factor. Where the asset pricing modeler wants to choose an asset pricing model, whereas the adversary wants to choose conditions under which the asset pricing model performs badly. In each iteration, the advarsary select the moment conditions that lead to the largest mispricing, and the modeler revise the candidate SDF to encorporate the identifed factor . In addition, they use LSTM and take the final output layer as a summarized state of the time varing macroeconomic condition  |   46 time-varying, firm-specific
characteristics and 178 macroeconomic time series     |            |
