**Category:** Factor discovery / representation learning/Latent factor models

<details>
  <summary><b>üìÑ Summary</b></summary>

  <p>Introduces a conditional autoencoder that learns low-dimensional latent factors and nonlinear factor loadings from firm characteristics. The model improves out-of-sample pricing and produces smaller pricing errors than many linear methods (e.g., IPCA) while allowing flexible nonlinear exposures.</p>
</details>

**üß† Data Used:** March 1957 (the start date of the S&P 500) and ends in December 2016, totaling 60 years. 
94 characteristics (61 of which are updated annually, 13 updated quarterly, and 20
updated monthly).
rank-normalize all characteristics into the interval (‚àí1, 1)
any filters based on stock prices or share codes, or rule out financial
firms. Past literature has imposed these filters in large part because they find it difficult to reconcile the return behavior
of low-price stocks, uncommon share codes, and financial sector stocks with the rest of the sample
Median imputation throughout the dataset so they have the full range of 30000 company data.

<details>
  <summary><b>‚ö†Ô∏è Challenges / Limitations</b></summary>

  <p>- Model interpretability: learned latent factors are nonlinear and harder to economically interpret.
- Overfitting risk if not carefully regularized or validated (autoencoders can memorize noise).
- Requires large cross-sectional and time-series data; performance may degrade for smaller markets.</p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>üîÆ Future Directions</b></summary>

  <p>- Develop methods to map learned latent factors to economic primitives (interpretability tools).
- Extend to multi-asset settings (bonds, options) and mixed-frequency data.
- Robustness checks under transaction costs and limits-to-arbitrage constraints.</p>
